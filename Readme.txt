Like the title says, this is a smart and easy shop, that will also fit everywhere.

It is a mix of a vending machine, a shop, item frames and light.

The owner can toggle it between unlimited and limited supply,
if they have `give` or `creative` privs.

Smartshops work with pipeworks and aliveai.

Additions by gpcf:
  - Mail support: Smartshops send mails out if stock is empty
  - Statistics: Smartshops make statistics on prices and stock
  - Smartshops only accept items they sell via pipeworks
