202412 (SwissalpS) Reworks the entire mod. First time it has a version indicator
	  in global smartshop.version. Before that there was just the "4r" indication
	  in Readme.txt and that never seemed to have been updated since 20171118.
	Significant changes:
	- smartshop.itemstats -> smartshop.item_stats
	- smartshop.itemprices -> smartshop.item_prices
	- smartshop.stuffsold -> removed
	- smartshop.itemsatpos() -> smartshop.set_count_pos() (old will still work)
	- smartshop.itempriceatpos() -> smartshop.set_price_pos() (old will still work)
	- Database of prices and items has changed the pos format slightly to take into
	  account the four slots. If you have a script/mod using smartshop's database
	  you may want to adapt: old pos '(<x>,<y>,<z>)' new format '(<x>,<y>,<z>)<i>'
	  where 'i' is one of 1, 2, 3 or 4. Old style entries are removed if the shop is
	  wrenched, jumped or the node is dug up.
	- /smreport is limited by priv.
	- Report is no longer automatically exported by default, server setting is provided
	  to restore old behaviour.
	- Statistics can be turned off entirely, this does not influence the infotext stats.
	Mentionable changes:
	- Code restructured and uses functions of this decade (entities mainly).
	  Code split into multiple files.
	- Added mod.conf, settingtypes.txt and .luacheckrc. Moved Readme.txt to .md.
	- Translation support added.
	- Entities now have the same order no matter in which of the four 'allowed'
	  directions the shop is facing.
	- /smartshop_fix_entities added.
	- Entities are fully removed when shop is dug, wrenched or jumped with jumpdrive.
	- Shops are now blast resistant and can't be moved with mvps compliant nodes.
	- Statistics are updated when shop is dug, wrenched or jumped with jumpdrive.
	- Statistics can be set to not include non minegeld sales in stock-count.
	  You may want to reset your statistcs anyway after installing this version.
	  Shops will be re-added whenever a manager closes the formspec, places
	  wrenched shop or jumps them.
	- Actually migrate pre-ghost shops - probably too late now anyway.
	- Client view has been tweaked to show numbers better.
	- Administrator view has improved to better show unlimited storage messages.
	- 50 and 100 minegeld notes and 5, 10 and 25 cent coins are now also recognized.
	  (This only has an effect on statistics.)
	Other notes:
	- It was decided not to move to modstorage in this re-write. That is something
	  for a later update should it be requested.
	- It was decided not to add an option to disallow non-mg payments. This would
	  take away a lot of the flexibility of the shop and is only interesting for a few
	  commerce oriented servers.
